# 2bit-ui

2bit-ui is a CSS library for making retro-inspired web pages using just four colors.

Go to [2bit-ui.wavebeem.com](https://2bit-ui.wavebeem.com) for examples, documentation, and usage.

## Development

You can use npm to load 2bit-ui on a local server.

```
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

Edit `src/2bit-ui.css`. It's the only file that gets published to npm. Open your browser to the URL printed in your terminal.

> If you're unfamiliar with npm, you can [download the Node.js installer here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) to get started with npm. Read more about [how to use npm here](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-npm/).

## Publishing

You can use npm to publish a new version of 2bit-ui.

```
npm version X.Y.Z
```
